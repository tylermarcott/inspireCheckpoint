// NOTE: in the instructions, they say we have to use multiple controllers and services, but they say nothing about actually making multiple models. I think since we are taking in the images, weather and quotes as objects, we do not need to make models for them. This is because models are class declarations. We can turn objects into classes lol.


// export class Image {
//   constructor(data) {
//     this.url = data.largeImgUrl
//     this.author = data.author
//   }




//   get imageTemplate() {
//     return `
  
//       <div class="image-fluid">
//       <p>${this.author}</p>
//         <img src="${this.url}" alt="bad-img">
//       </div>
  
  
//   `

//   }












// }
